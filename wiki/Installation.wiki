Details
Event UUID (e.g. 20090319-y1)

    * aim: provide ordering and some level of readability to event UUID
    * format: <8-digit date when event started>-<event id unique within date>
    * fixed width: no
    * order: by date
    * grouping: by event type within date
    * examples:
          o 20090319-d1
          o 00000000-n124 (this means there are probably at least 124 intro talks on an unknown date)
