#summary UUIDs for event, session, video, audio and photos

= Introduction =

Here we define the format of UUIDs for the various entities. These UUIDs provide more than just uniqueness. They also provide a certain level of readability as well as ordering.

==Event UUID==

  * format: <8-digit event start date>-<event id unique within date>
  * fixed width: no
  * order implies: by date, then grouping by event type within date
  * examples:
    * 20090319-d1
    * xxxxxxxx-n124 (this means there are probably at least 124 intro talks on an unknown date)

===<8-digit date>===

  * format: <4-digit year><2-digit month><2-digit day-of-month>
  * fixed width: yes
  * order implies: chronological order
  * examples:
    * 20090319 (if date known)
    * xxxxxxxx (if date not known)
    * 2009xxxx (if only year known)

===<event id unique within date>===

  * format: <variable width event type><variable width integer providing uniqueness>===
  * fixed width: no
  * order implies: nothing significant (although naturally events of same type group together)
  * notes: So for the same date we can have "n1" and "y1" - i.e. we can reuse the integer for different event types.
  * examples:
    * n1 (intro talk)
    * n2 (another intro talk on the same day)
    * y1 (bramhachari meet)
